                <ul>
                    <li>Web Developer Intern at Nimblr Inc: I optimized the client registration process for one of our services in order to improve and optimize the quality of the application service. This was a full stack project that included frontend using Vue.js, backend with Node.js and database management with MySQL.
                    I also created documentation to install Linux Ubuntu in order to help new employees to install the company GitHub repository.
                    As part of the support team, I assisted customers in resolving basic issues with the company platform.</li>
                    <li>Data Science Minor: I pursued a Minor in Artificial Intelligence during my bachelor's degree. In this minor, I extensively used Python and libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow to gain knowledge in deep learning and machine learning. For my final project, I developed a Messenger chatbot using Dialogflow CX and other Google services. This chatbot could sell products while conversing with clients and check the order status once registered.</li>
